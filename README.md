# Romaniser
## - Roman Numerals Converter
- A project made during Founders and Coders Course, in Week 2
- Aim is to introduce us to testing frameworks and test driven development (TDD), with the test framework, [Tape](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tape)
- First commit is for the converter script alone
- Second commit is for the script to work in the DOM

### Future Goals
- Use LocalStorage to save specific number conversions for later use
